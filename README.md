# HACK20NOTES
Journaling app with cyberpunk UI
This app runs on both Android and ios devices, so there is no issue with the platform. This app allows users to take notes on the go and has minimalistic UI. Anyone can write and share notes.These partially act as virtual Sticky notes or To-do lists and which totally depends upon the needs of the user. This App can also act like a virtual notebook for students where each note acts like a page.. It’s  a great way to set aside our overwhelm so that we can focus on the task at hand.If we want to become the best in our field, taking notes helps it happen. As we students build our career and keep track of what we’re learning, we’ll have easy access to our very own refresher courses.
